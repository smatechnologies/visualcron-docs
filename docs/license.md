If the trial period has ended, there is no way of using future upgrades without ordering the full license. See Upgrade/Updates below.

### Perpetual vs Subscription license

As of February 14, 2022, VisualCron has migrated from Perpetual License model to Subscription license model. Licenses purchased before this date remain perpetual with the exception of the **Support limitations** (as described above).

With the new subscription license, the renewal of the Subscription is mandatory for Jobs to execute on the VisualCron Server.

The license key will unlock the Software for use on the computer it is installed on. Once installed the license key can only be utilized on that computer Once the license key is used, the code can no longer be used and is considered inactive. . As such, activation is one (1) time only. Under limited circumstances, upon Licensor’s discretion , the license key can be reactivated and used again. You may request to move a license to another server. These operations (reset/transfer/move) require, a) that you have an active Maintenance account or Subscription in good standing; and b) that the operation is manually approved by Licensor’s staff.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that we will not intentionally include any Trojan horses, worms, or other codes designed to disable the Software once installed pursuant to this Agreement.
 
### Activation and deactivation of a license

The process of deactivating / moving a license requires that you have an active Maintenance account in good standing.
