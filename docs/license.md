We reserve all rights in and to the VC Software Package not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.

We hereby grant you a nonexclusive license to use one (1) copy of the VC Software Package on any single computer, provided the software included in the VC Software Package is in use only on one (1) computer at any time. "Use" means to download, install, access, use, execute, or otherwise benefit from the VC Software Package.

You may only copy the VC Software Package, or any part therein, for back-up, disaster recovery, testing, and archival purposes, provided that the original and each copy is kept in your possession and that your installation and use of the VC Software Package does not exceed what is allowed by this Section.

An activation code will be provided to you to access and use the VC Software Package. The activation code delivered to you is personal to you and cannot be disclosed to any other person other than as a transfer of all your rights as described herein. The use of your activation code by anyone other than you, or failure to adhere to any provision within this Section will be deemed a willful violation of this license and subject to the immediate suspension or termination of this Agreement.

### Proprietary Rights

The VC Software Package is the intellectual property and all associated rights of the Licensor, which are protected by Swedish copyright and patent laws, international treaty provisions, and applicable laws of the country in which it is being used.

### Documentation

Documentation for the VC Software Package can be found [here](https://help.visualcron.com/) (hereinafter referred to as “Order Documents”) and is provided online and by installation in PDF format. Use Adobe Acrobat Reader to open the document. The Order Documents included in this Section can be changed anytime, and therefore, we highly recommend using the online Order Documents.

Any updates or changes to the Order Documents found online (and linked above) are generally completed as part of new software releases, which can occur at any time and are announced to all licensed and registered users.


### Trial period

The VC Software Package has a trial period of thirty (30) days. The trial period gives you a chance to fully test the software free of charge. After the trial period has ended, you will no longer be able to control or have access to features within the VC Software Package.

When the trial period ends, any future upgrades will not be made available unless or until a full license is ordered. See Upgrade/Updates below.


### Support Limitations

A Maintenance License is a license that provides a perpetual key; this type of license does not provide upgrades, and only an annual payment of maintenance is required. The end-user must have an active Maintenance License and /or have purchased the VC Software Package (collectively a “Subscription”) that is in good standing. An active Subscription is required on the Server in question that the support is related to. The support is limited to only employees of the end-user. Any third-party support or developers must have at least one (1) active Subscription.

 

### Perpetual vs Subscription license

Licenses purchased before February 14, 2022, will remain Maintenance Licenses with the exception of the Support Limitations (as described above).  With the VC Software Package, the renewal of a Subscription is mandatory for the functionality of features in the VC Software Package, including but not limited to actions to add tasks and trigger conditions or notifications (otherwise known as “Jobs”) to continue to be enabled.  

### Version - End-of-life support

Each version of the software in the VC Software Package is supported for one (1) year after the release date. After that, an upgrade is recommended to enable all the technical changes that occur throughout the year. Release dates can be found [here](https://help.visualcron.com/changelog).

### License Key 

The license key will unlock the VC Software Package for use on the computer it is installed on. Once installed, the license key can only be utilized on that computer. Once the license key is used, the code can no longer be used and is considered inactive. As such, activation is one (1) time only. Under limited circumstances, upon Licensor’s discretion, the license key can be reactivated and used again. You may request to move a license to another server. These operations (reset/transfer/move) require a) that you have an active Maintenance License or Subscription in good standing; and b) that the operation is manually approved by Licensor.

Notwithstanding anything herein, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that we will not intentionally include any trojan horses, worms, or other codes designed to disable the VC Software Package once installed pursuant to this Agreement.

 

### Activation and Deactivation of a License

The process of deactivating or moving a license requires that you have an active Subscription in good standing.

 

### License Types and Limitations

a.Single server license - can be installed in and moved but may not be used on more than one (1) server at the same time. This can include an installation purpose, test, development, or production machine. Single server licenses are categorized as Basic, Standard, and Pro. Details of what is included in each tier and pricing can be found [here](https://www.visualcron.com/Order.aspx).


b.Site license - allows unlimited server installations within a single physical location (i.e. a data center). New site licenses were discontinued in July of 2024.

c.Country license - allows unlimited server installations within a single country. New site licenses were discontinued in July of 2024.

d.World license - allows unlimited server installations worldwide. New site licenses were discontinued in July of 2024.


For "unlimited" cloud installations, it is up to discussion depending on usage, expected quantity, and locations. The suggested solution may result in a specific agreement that results in two (2) or more Site licenses, a Country license, or a World license.


### Upgrades/Updates

Updates with new functionality and fixes to technical issues may be released at any time. A Subscription in good standing is necessary to receive updates and upgrades to a newer version. A Subscription in good standing will also give you access to support.

 

### Reporting of Technical Issues

*Locations of Functions and Data Processing*

The VC Software Package installations and functions are onsite at your location. You manage the application and where the data is stored otherwise known as “Service Locations”. Any changes to the Service Locations are made at your discretion. In the event that, these terms are modified such that Licensor has the ability to change a Service Location, such change will be documented in writing, and

Licensor will provide timely notification providing sufficient information to enable you to assess the risks and impact of the use of VC Software Package, any data processing if applicable and storage locations (including any impact on the agreed service levels and the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data processing) and/or to object thereto. Both parties shall ensure that the Service Locations are and will remain in the European Union, unless the parties have approved otherwise in writing.

 

### Confidentiality

“Confidential Information” means all information and materials obtained by a party (the “Recipient”) from the other party (the “Disclosing Party”), whether in tangible form, written or oral, that is identified as confidential or would reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure, including without limitation Customer Data, the VC Software Package, and the terms and pricing set out in the Order Documents. Confidential Information does not include information that (a) is already known to the Recipient prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (b) is or becomes generally known through no wrongful act of the Recipient; (c) is independently developed by the Recipient without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (d) is received from a third party without restriction and without a breach of an obligation of confidentiality. The Recipient shall not use or disclose any Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party’s prior written permission, except to its employees, contractors, directors, representatives, or consultants who have a need to know in connection with this Agreement or Recipient’s business generally, or as otherwise allowed herein. The Recipient shall protect the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own confidential information of a similar nature but using not less than a reasonable degree of care. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that it is required to be disclosed pursuant to a statutory or regulatory provision or court order, provided that the Recipient provides prior notice of such disclosure to the Disclosing Party unless such notice is prohibited by law, rule, regulation or court order. As long as the VC Software Package and/or any Order Documents are active under this Agreement and for two (2) years thereafter, the confidentiality provisions of this Section shall remain in effect.
