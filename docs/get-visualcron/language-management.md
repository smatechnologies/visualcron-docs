## Language Management

When the VisualCron client is started after an initial installation, it is possible to select a preferred language. However, this language selection only affects the language in the client user interface.
 
In VisualCron system related functions, it is not possible to change language from English. Examples of such areas are states (e.g. Server On/Off) and logging.
 
The information in the VisualCron web site and all documentation/demos etc. are only available in English. The user definable texts in demo Jobs/Tasks available after an initial installation are also in English.
