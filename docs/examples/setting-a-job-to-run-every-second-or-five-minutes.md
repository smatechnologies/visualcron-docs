## Setting a Job to Run Every Second Minute or Five Minutes

To set something to run every second minute you go to Add/Edit Job -> Time settings -> Minute.
 
If you want it to run every second minute you must have 1 minute between each execute. You can then for example choose minutes 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and so on up to 58.
 
If you want to run every 5 minute you choose 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and so on up to 55. Remember, if you want to do this every hour, you must also choose Every hour.
