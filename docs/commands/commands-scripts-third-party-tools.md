## Commands, Scripts, and Third Party Tools

VisualCron in itself is quite clean in functionality. VisualCron just executes programs/commands at a given time or at a certain event. In this way there is no limit in how many things VisualCron can do. Any command can be executed that in itself does "anything". Here some utilities are presented, that can be useful for any Job. Some utilities may be developed by NetCart AB and some by 3rd parties.
 
There are different ways to accomplish what you want to do. Most things can be done with any scripting language for example Perl, PHP or VBScript. You can also accomplish a lot with the built in commands in the operating system. Find the way that feels comfortable for you. Look in the examples section for some solutions.
 
Please submit your favorite command, program, tool or utility via the [contact web page](https://www.visualcron.com/contact.aspx). Also, make a suggestion if you have an idea of a useful utility that can't be found elsewhere.
 
The solutions are divided into the followings parts:
 
### Commands and Batch Files

These are built in commands in windows. Microsoft has provided a lot of tools for accomplishing different Tasks.
 
### Scripts

With scripts you are more flexible. On Windows we recommend using PHP or VBScript.
 
### Third Party Tools

This may be utilities written by other companies than NetCart AB or Microsoft.
