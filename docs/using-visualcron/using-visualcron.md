## Overview

Using VisualCron is simple, just start the VisualCron client. With the ordinary Windows graphical interface, all Jobs, Tasks and settings are managed. Unless otherwise stated, all user actions refer to VisualCron client application.
 
Please note that VisualCron is initially started with server status On. Read [here](../client-user-interface/server/server-on-off) for more information.
 
For some actions like log, debug and email notification, you need to have knowledge in computer file handling and email account settings.
