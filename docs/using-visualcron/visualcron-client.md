## VisualCron Client

The VisualCron Client is a separate application that constitutes the main type of user interface for VisualCron. With the client you configure VisualCron and manage the Jobs and Tasks that are run by the server.
 
Several VisualCron clients can be connected to the same VisualCron server, typically a user have both the VisualCron client application and the VisualCron tray client connected to the same server. See main menu **Server > Main settings > Client connections** for a list of clients that are connected to the currently selected server.
 
The VisualCron client application can also switch its server connection in the [server selection](../client-user-interface/toolbar/server-selection) drop-down list in the leftmost part of the toolbar.
