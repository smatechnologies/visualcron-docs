## Maintenance Expiration

In the Client you can see the expiration date for the Maintenance in the Server row. This date is refreshed from time to time and may not be directly synced in Client when you purchase a renewal of the Maintenance. To force a sync you can right click on the Server row and choose Refresh license data. If the date is not refreshed please make sure you have associated the Maintenance code online that you purchased with the license you wanted to renew. After doing that you can choose to Refresh license data again.
