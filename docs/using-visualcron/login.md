## Login

When the VisualCron client is started, an initial login (to server) window is opened. You need to login because the server may be accessed also from other computers. If you haven't defined any connection, VisualCron will use the default server login parameters.
 
For security reasons, you should change user name and password after the initial login in the main menu **Server > Main settings > User permissions** dialog.
 
If you want to add new connections, for example to other computers, you select the main menu **File > Servers > Manage servers** option. See [manage servers](../client-user-interface/file/manage-servers) for more information.
