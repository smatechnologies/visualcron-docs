## Move a License

1. Download and install VisualCron on your new server (if this is the first time you install VisualCron you will have 30 days of trial with full functionality)
2. Validate on the My licenses page that you have a Maintenance contract that supports the installed new version for the latest version so you do not run into license problems when trying to activate it later
3. Go to the old server and backup your settings using Export from the menu **File > Export settings**
4. Transfer the file to the new server and import it clearing existing settings (unless you already created new Jobs on Server)
5. If the import was successful you can choose **Server > Information > License > Deactivate** in the old Server
6. Go to the new Server and Activate it with the old activation code
 
If you have any Deactivation/Activation problems contact us [here](https://www.visualcron.com/Contact.aspx).
 
If the Server is decommissioned and no longer available please go to [My licenses page](https://www.visualcron.com/Login.aspx?DestinationPageUrl=~%2fMyLicenses.aspx) and click on the Move button next to the activation code.
 
Deactivation / Move a license requires that you have an active Maintenance.
