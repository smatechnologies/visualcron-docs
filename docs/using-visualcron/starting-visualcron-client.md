## Starting VisualCron Client

The client application is started from the Windows desktop icon (VisualCron X) or the Start menu *Program > VisualCron X > VisualCron Client*. You can also double click on or open the [VisualCron Tray Client](visualcron-tray-client) to start the VisualCron Client.
 
As the VisualCron server handles the defined Jobs, the VisualCron client can only connect to the VisualCron server when the server is running.
 
As the VisualCron server runs as a service, the client application can be closed without affecting the core server activities.
