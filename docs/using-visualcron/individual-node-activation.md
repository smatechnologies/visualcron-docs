## Individual Node Activation

After nodes are created you can activate your nodes. You need either a unique activation or an unlimited one (like Site license) for each node.
 
1. Go to active node and use activation code and use activation code there (unique or unlimited)

2. Switch to second node and check activation status. If it is already activated the deactivate this node and activate with the second activation code (if you are not using an unlimited one).
