## Why Does My Firewall Warn / Why Does VisualCron Try to Access the Internet?

At startup, VisualCron will try to check for new updates. To do this VisualCron needs to access the Internet. In this way you will be notified of the latest changes when a new version is released. If you don't want use this feature you can uncheck this option in the settings-dialog.
 
Also, from VisualCron version 2.0.0 and up, VisualCron needs to access the Internet in the following cases:
* When VisualCron is installed
* When trying to connect to a remote VisualCron server
* When trying the register name and email for newsletter
 
If you have a firewall application running, you should respond with "Allow connections on all ports, everytime".
