## How Do I Move A License / Activate VisualCron On a New Server?

If you already have activated VisualCron on one server you must de-activate your old install first before being able to activate on a new server.
 
To deactivate your old license you need to:
 
1. Install the trial on new server
2. Connect to the Server with the Client
3. Export any settings from old server through File menu->Export to a secure location
4. Import any settings in new server through File menu->Import
5. Choose Deactivate license in Server tab->License->Deactivate
6. Activate your license on the new server
 
Please note that Deactivation / Move a license requires that you have an active Maintenance.
