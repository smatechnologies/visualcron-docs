## Paste Job

When a Job is defined, right-click on the Job or Task in the Server/Group/Job/Task grid and select P*aste Job '`<Job name>`'* to paste a previously copied Job.
 
The copy Job function copies the Job temporarily to the memory which makes is possible to paste the Job to another server than the one that is currently connected.
