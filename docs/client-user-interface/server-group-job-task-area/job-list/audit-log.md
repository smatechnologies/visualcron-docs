## Audit Log

When a Job is defined, right-click on the Job or Task in the Server/Group/Job/Task grid and select *Audit log* to open the audit log window.
 
This window uses the same structure as the main menu **Tools > Objects > Audit log** option. See [here](../../tools/objects-audit-log) for more information.
