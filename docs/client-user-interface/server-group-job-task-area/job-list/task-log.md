## Task Log

When a Task is defined, right-click on the Task in the Server/Group/Job/Task grid and select Task log to open the log window. This window looks the same as the one opened by **Server > Information > Log** (see [Information log](../../server/information-log)), except that the Task related log window only shows a specific Task history.
