## Activate/Deactivate Job

By default an added (new) Job is set to active. The "active" status for a Job is indicated by a green (green check icon) while the "deactive" status is indicated by a red (red cross icon) icon in the leftmost part for each specific Job in the Server/Group/Job/Task grid. It is possible to change status in the right-click menu for a Job by the *Activate/Daactivate Job '`<Job name>`'* option.
 
If you look at the Job list for status indication, please note that any Job list column, including the status column, can be set to invisible.
 
It is also possible to *Activate/Deactivate* a Task status by right-click on a Task and select the *Activate/Deactivate Task '`<Task name>`'* option.
