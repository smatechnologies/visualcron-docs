## Clone Job

When a Job is defined, right-click on the Job or Task in the Server/Group/Job/Task grid and select *Clone Job '`<Job name>`'* to clone the Job.
 
A Job, marked in the Server/Group/Job/Task grid, can also be cloned by the toolbar *Clone* Job button.
 
All settings for an already defined Job can be cloned (copied) into a new Job. Except for pure Job settings all triggers, Tasks, notifications etc. are also copied to the new Job without any change. Only change of *Job Name* is necessary before the new Job can be saved, but of course any other change of the new Job is possible.
 
Clone Job always works locally, i.e. a cloned Job can only be added to the currently connected server.
