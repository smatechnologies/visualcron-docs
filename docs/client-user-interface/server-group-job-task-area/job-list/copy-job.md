## Copy Job

When a Job is defined, right-click on the Job or Task in the Server/Group/Job/Task grid and select *Copy Job '`<Job name>`'* to copy the Job.
 
The copy Job function copies the Job temporarily to the memory which makes is possible to paste the Job to another server than the one that is currently connected.
