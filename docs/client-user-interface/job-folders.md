## Job Folders

Job folders were introduced in version 8.3.5. With Job folders you can create a folder structure which you can reference Jobs to. When you click on that Job folder only the the Jobs, that belongs to that folder, will be filtered in the main grid.
 
Job folders are located in the left pane of the main window. You can right click in that window to create new folders. You can right click on a folder create a sub folder. Right click to Delete or Rename a folder.
 
In the right Job pane you can either right click on Add to folder and select a Job folder to add to. Once added you will have a selection mark next to the folder name in the popup menu. You can also drag one Job from the right pane into a Job folder in the left pane.
