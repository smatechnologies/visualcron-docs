## Server Selection

If you have added multiple servers in the main menu **File > Servers > Manage servers**, you can quickly switch between these in the leftmost drop down list in the VisualCron client toolbar. Select the desired server you want to switch to. If you don't want to enter password between switches, then add the password in Manage servers window. During the server switch, the main window is disabled.
 
You can see which server you are connected to in the toolbar item list or in the main menu `Server [<server name]` tab. The progress of the server switch is visible in the progress bar to the right in the status bar of the main window - when full, all values has been loaded to the client.
 
:::info Note 

The VisualCron client is for performance reasons only connected to one server at a time. The information you see (Jobs etc.) are only related to the current server connection.
