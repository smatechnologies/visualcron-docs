## Explore - Connection Explorer

With the main menu **Tools > Explore > Connection Explorer** option, there is one way to view your remote files, delete and transfer files - on your existing Connections. It is also a way of testing existing Connections and retrieve correct path for download or upload folders.

**Right click menu**

Right click on a file or folder to:

* create a new folder
* delete a file or folder
* view (download and show with default application)

**Limitations**

Some FTP servers require special parsing due to non-standard output. These may not work in the Client but work in the Tasks.
