You will access these sub items by either double clicking on a Connection or right click and select Connect.
 
When connected you can:

* Open and edit a table by double clicking on a table
* Perform edit in form and grid view
* Delete rows
* Scroll through rows
* Filter rows
* Click on new query button to perform your own SQL query against any open connection
