## Objects

VisualCron uses a combination of internal objects to make configuration easier. For example Credentials are used to raise permission in a Task or Trigger.
 
In the Objects window you can see these [relations](object-relations), [search/replace](object-search) and [replace/merge](object-replace-merge).
