## Filter - Grid Filter

With the main menu **Interface > Filter > Grid filter** option and the toolbar Grid filter button it is possible to show or hide the *grid filter*. When changing, the settings are saved and if checked when closing you will see the *grid filter* above the main grid when you start up the client again.
 
The *grid filter* lets you filter the list of Servers, Groups, Jobs and Tasks.
 
Press the *Clear filter* button to clear the filter field.
 
Select the Job attribute (in the drop down window starting with the "Job name" attribute) and then type characters in the filter field that shall match the selected attribute for the Job(s) you want to be shown in the Server/Jobs/Task grid. Filtering is dynamic, i.e.   matching rows are instantly removed.
 
All changes have immediate effect on what is shown in the Server/Group/Job/Task grid.
