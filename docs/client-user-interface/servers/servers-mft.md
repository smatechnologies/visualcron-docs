## Servers - MFT Server

In the main menu Server > Servers > MFT the MFT Server settings are managed.
 
The MFT Server provides built in support for hosting, inside VisualCron, for the following server types:

* SFTP
* FTP
 
The advantages of using VisualCron for this are:

* You are not dependent on any second installation of a third party server.
* VisualCron can react faster to any changes within the server through the MFT Trigger. The MFT Trigger can react on various events like file uploaded, download, folder created etc
* Through the Web Client, VisualCron users can manage the files (delete, upload, download)

**Use passive mode**

FTP is a TCP based service exclusively. There is no UDP component to FTP. FTP is an unusual service in that it utilizes two ports, a 'data' port and a 'command' port (also known as the control port). Traditionally these are port 21 for the command port and port 20 for the data port. The confusion begins however, when we find that depending on the mode, the data port is not always on port 20. In order to resolve the issue of the server initiating the connection to the client a different method for FTP connections was developed. This was known as passive mode, or PASV, after the command used by the client to tell the server it is in passive mode.
 
**Passive mode host**

Enter IP or DNS name for resolving IP for passive mode or check Use default host for using the current IP of the server.
 
**Use default host**

Use the current IP of the server.
 
**Use custom port range**
