## Servers - Sync Server Objects

Server Sync provides the ability to sync Jobs and global objects between two or ore more VisualCron Servers. It is idea for Master/Slave or Productio/Test relationships between Servers.
 
 
One Server can subscribe to the following events for all objects on another Server:
 
* Added (New)
* Updated
* Deleted
 
You can Sync objects manually or setup a Server to sync automatically.
 
 
This feature was introduced in version 9.2.0 of VisualCron.
 
**Main window**
 
The main window contains a list of all automated (real time) sync settings. Normally, one row represents a remote Server you want to sync from but it is possible to setup multiple sync settings against one Server.
