## Global - Task Repository

The Task repository is a shared Task library for the VisualCron community. The primary focus is on Tasks of type PowerShell and .NET Execute Tasks. The idea is that anyone can create a code snippet using any of these Task types and then share that code snipped (in Task) to the VisualCron community. After that, anyone in the community (depending on share settings) can access this Task and download locally.
 
The Task repository can be found in **Server tab->Global objects->Task** repository.
 
 
**Variables**

What makes Task repository even more useful is that you can execute these Task repository Tasks through Variables. In the Variables browser you can see all Task repository Tasks and send your own arguments. The Variable string itself can be used in any field within VisualCron.
