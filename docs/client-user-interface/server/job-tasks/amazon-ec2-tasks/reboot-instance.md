## Task Amazon EC2 - Reboot Instance

The Amazon EC2 - Reboot instance requests a boot of one or more instances. This operation is asynchronous; it only queues a request to reboot the specified instances. The operation succeeds if the instances are valid and belong to you. Requests to reboot terminated instances are ignored.
