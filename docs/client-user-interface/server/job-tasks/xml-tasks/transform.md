## Task XML - Transform

The XML - Transform Task transforms a XML file to HTML using an XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language) file. You can also provide the XSLT parameter which will be replaced by its value dynamically. XSLT is an XML-based language used for the transformation of XML documents into other XML documents.
 
The original document is not changed; rather, a new document is created based on the code of an existing one. The new document can be output to HTML or plain text.
 
**XML Transform > File filter > Location** sub tab

The XML Transform Task uses the standard VisualCron [File filter](../../../server/job-tasks-file-filter) to define the properties of the listed files.
