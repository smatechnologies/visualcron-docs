**Folder**

Specify the name of a folder to delete on the server. If the server supports it you can specify a relative path; ```/folder/subfolder```. If not, you first have to use the change folder command (if you are not already in that folder).
If sub folder(s) to a folder to be deleted exist, also these are deleted.
