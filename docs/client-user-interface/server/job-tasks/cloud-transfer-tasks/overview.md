## Overview

Cloud storage is a model of data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, the physical storage spans multiple servers (and often locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company.
 
The Cloud Tasks in VisualCron currently supports the following cloud services:

* [Amazon S3](../../connection-amazon)
* [Box](../../connection-box)
* [DropBox](../../connection-dropbox)
* [Google Drive](../../connection-google-drive)
* [Microsoft Azure](../../connection-microsoft-azure)
* [OneDrive](../../connection-onedrive)
 
Different [Connections](../../global-connections) are used depending on the different cloud service providers.
 
The same interface is shared for the different cloud services.
 
In order to simplify and unify common parameters, the standard VisualCron Cloud remote file filter is used in the below list of Cloud Tasks:

* [List item(s)](list-item)
* [Download file(s)](download-file)
* [Delete item(s)](delete-item)
