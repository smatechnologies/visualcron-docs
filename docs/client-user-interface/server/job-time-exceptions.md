## Job - Time Exceptions

Time exceptions are "global", which means that once a [time exception](timeexception) is defined it can be selected by one or more Jobs. The activated collections include time definitions when the Job will NOT run, i.e. blocking time(s) and interval(s) set in the other _Time settings_ sub tabs.
 
A time exception is a complement to the _Time_ trigger settings.
