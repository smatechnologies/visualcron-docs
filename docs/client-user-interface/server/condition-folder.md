**Folder path**

First you have to select a folder. Write the full UNC path to the folder or select it by clicking on the Folder browser icon to the right.
 
**Credentials**

If your folder is located at a network resource or any other protected area it may require some "credentials" to access that folder. Select a credential from the list. The credentials are stored globally which lets you create new credentials that can be accessed in different levels and function of VisualCron. Click on Manage credentials to add a credential that you may require.
 
**Folder exists**

This checks whether a folder exists or not. Select True or False.
