## Job - Agent Distribution

**Agent distribution** is a setting up of a certain Job so that execution of the Job can be performed not only on the local Server, but also on one or more Servers connected to the Broker Server.
In addition to this setting, you may need to specify in the Load balancer settings the method according to which Servers are selected for Job execution.
 
See the [Load balancer - Execution Distribution](../servers/execution-distribution) topic for configuration information.
