## Main - Server On/Off

In the main menu **Server > Main settings > Server** dialog, the VisualCron server status can be set to "On" or "Off". The server status is indicated and/or managed by any connected client by the "Server [On]" or "Server [Off]" text in the main menu Server option.
 
The status "Server [Off]" means that the service is running but the server doesn't execute the defined Jobs or Tasks, and the _NextRun_ field for any active Job will show the "Server off" text. Switching to "Server[Off]" may be used as an emergency stop for the current Job/Task execution.
 
Once you have changed the server status, the status will be saved and VisualCron will use that status the next time the server computer is started.
