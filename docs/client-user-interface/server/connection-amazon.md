### Troubleshooting

**General**

Test the S3 explorer if it is working there.
 
**HTTP request failed with code 403 (Forbidden)**

Test with S3 explorer and look for error message. Generally this error comes if you do not have listing permissions on Buckets for the user. Please add permission - otherwise Tasks will not work properly.
 
**SignatureDoesNotMatch**

Uncheck/Check Use version 4 signatures.
 
**Connection lost (error code is 100353)**

Most likely a proxy error. You need to define a Proxy in the Proxy tab of the Connection.
 
**The hostname could not be parsed**

Make sure you have selected a Amazon region.
 
**HTTP request failed with code 400 (Bad Request). Erroc code: AuthorizationHeaderMalformed.**

The Amazon user is lacking "List buckets" permission.
