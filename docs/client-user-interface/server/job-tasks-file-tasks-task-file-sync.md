**Credential**

To access a remote computer you may need to use a [Credential](global-credentials). Normally that Credential is a remote or AD user with "Local logon" unchecked. The Credential must match the user name and password of the user that you want to login for. Select a Credential in the combo box or click the *Settings* icon to open *Manage credentials* in order to add or edit Credentials. This Credential is used to access the destination directory.
 
 
**Destination folder**

Specify a absolute path to the directory you want to sync between.
 
 
**Destination->General** tab
 
**Sync type**

Both sides - this option allows mirroring of files against two folders according to the current file filter.
 
 
**Propagate deletions**

If in one side the file is deleted - on the other side:

1. do nothing (the file remains)
2. delete file to trash
3. rename the deleted file by adding the version number to the name, the number of file versions in the directory is controlled
4. move the deleted file to the specified folder, manage the cleaning of the folder by the number of days or by file version numbers, the file rename format is set in the field, the current keywords are " `{file}`
" and "
`{version}`
", the first is replaced by the current name, the second is replaced with the version number, if the number of versions is exceeded, the previous versions of the files are renamed with the lower version number.
