**Authentication type**

Choose between VIX or vSphere. VIX stands for the old API that uses COM libraries to manage vSphere. This is supported up to version 6.0 of vSphere. For future version the new vSphere API is used which is based on web services. The VMware vSphere® Web Services SDK includes all the components necessary to work with the VMware vSphere API, including WSDL files, sample code, and libraries. The vSphere Web Services SDK facilitates development of client applications that target the VMware vSphere API. With the vSphere Web Services SDK, developers can create client applications to manage, monitor, and maintain VMware vSphere components, as deployed on VMware® VMware vSphere® ESX®, ESXi™, and VMware® vCenter™ Server systems.

### Troubleshooting

*The protocol requested by peer '0 0 9 1' does not match expected '3 1 0 0'. Make sure both sides agree on protocol id and version.*
Please upgrade remote server to AMQP 1.0. VisualCron supports AMQP 1.0 or later.
