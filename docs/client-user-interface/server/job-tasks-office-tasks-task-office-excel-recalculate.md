## Task Office - Excel - Recalculate

Recalculates an existing Excel function/formula within a document and saves the document afterwards. This Task cannot update data from other data sources. Use the Office Macro Task for that.
 
**Excel - Recalculate > File filter > Location** sub tab

In the File filter tab you define which files should be recalculated. Read more about file filter [here](job-tasks-file-filter).
