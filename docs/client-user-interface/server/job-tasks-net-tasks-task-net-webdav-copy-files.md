## Task Net - WebDAV - Copy Files

The WebDAV - Copy/Move files lets you copy or move files that are located on one remote folder to another remote folder. Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is a set of methods based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that facilitates collaboration between users in editing and managing documents and files stored on World Wide Web servers.
