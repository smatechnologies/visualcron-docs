## Connection - Dropbox

The Dropbox Connection stores connect and login properties for the Dropbox cloud services. VisualCron supports Personal and Business service of Dropbox.
 
Dropbox is a [file hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_hosting_service). Dropbox allows users to create a special folder on their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of which device is used to view it. Files placed in this folder are also accessible via the Dropbox website and mobile apps. Dropbox uses a [freemium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium) business model, wherein users are offered a free account with a set storage size and paid subscriptions for accounts with more capacity
 
The Dropbox Connection is used in the following Cloud Tasks:

* [Cloud - Upload file(s)](../../client-user-interface/server/job-tasks/cloud-transfer-tasks/upload-file)
* [Cloud - List item(s)](../../client-user-interface/server/job-tasks/cloud-transfer-tasks/list-item)
* [Cloud - Download file(s)](../../client-user-interface/server/job-tasks/cloud-transfer-tasks/download-file)
* [Cloud - Create folder](../../client-user-interface/server/job-tasks/cloud-transfer-tasks/create-folder)
* [Cloud - Delete item(s)](../../client-user-interface/server/job-tasks/cloud-transfer-tasks/delete-item)
