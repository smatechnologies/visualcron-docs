## Task Reporting - Crystal Reports

The Crystal Reports Task allows you to output Crystal reports in various formats like PDF, Excel and to printer. With this Task you can specify in-parameters and record filter. The record filter can further narrow down the report query.
 
This Task uses the [Crystal Reports Connection](connection-crystalreports). It requires runtime files to be installed on the Server. You can find this in the Connection.
