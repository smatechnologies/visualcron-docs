### Troubleshooting
 
**Token null / empty**

Possible reasons for this error:
1.The Extra settings redirect uri is not matching the O365 redirect uri
2.There is a software already listening on the given url in extra settings (for example [http://localhost](http://localhost) is normally taken by a local web server as default port is 80)
3.There is a firewall on the VC server blocking the incoming redirect from the web browser
4.The authentication goes wrong â€“ wrong password, aborted auth window, crash in O365 web page
