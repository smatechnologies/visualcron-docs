### Troubleshooting

*"Password logon no longer possible", "No RFC authorization for function module BAPI_XMI_LOGON", "You have no authorization to log on to interface XBP"*

This is caused by incorrect user permissions in SAP. 1) Check with the SAP Administrator and make sure the user on the SAP side (from the Connection Profile being tested in the CCM) is not locked or having any issue related to authorizations/privileges. 2) Verify the authorizations of the user in the Connection Profile meet the minimums as documented in the Control-M for SAP Administrator Guide under the section "SAP Authorizations"
