## Connection - Twitter

The Twitter connection uses the online news and networking service Twitter where users post and interact with messages, "tweets", restricted to 40 characters. Registered users can post tweets, but those who are unregistered can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface, SMS or a mobile device app.
 
The Twitter Connection is used in the Twitter Tasks.
