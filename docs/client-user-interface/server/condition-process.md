## Condition - Process

The _Process_ condition lets you check information about a certain process before running your Task or Job.

**Process name**

Enter the process name or select the process from a list by clicking on the _Select_ process button. Note that the check is case sensitive and that processes spawned from the VisualCron server may be in upper case. A good way to find the right process name, is to first start the Task Manager at the server from VisualCron and then select the process from the list.
 
**Is running**

This checks whether a process is running or not. Select True or False.
