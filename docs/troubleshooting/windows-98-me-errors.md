## I Am Getting Errors on Windows 98/ME, what can I do?

Generally, VisualCron 2.0.0 or later isn't supported in the Windows 98/ME environments. We use this statement because VisualCron 2.0.0 or later is not tested in these environments as VisualCron 1.6.0 was.
 
VisualCron may run correctly also in the Windows 98/ME environments. However, no support from VisualCron will be provided.
